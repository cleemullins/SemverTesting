# SemverTesting
Experiments with Semver, C#, Visual Studio Online CI/CD, MyGet, and NuGet deployments

This repo is a playspace for leanring how Semver works with the VSO CI/CD build tasks. This includes concerns around:
* [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
* The [Semver Nuget Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/semver/)
* .Net Core 2
* Visual Studio Online CI/DI against GitHub
* Publishing correctly versioned packags to MyGet (and Nuget)
